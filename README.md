# ARP Spoofing

## Description

An ARP spoofing, also known as ARP poisoning, is a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack that allows attackers to intercept communication between network devices. This project demonstrates a basic implementation of ARP spoofing using Python and Scapy.

## What is ARP Spoofing (ARP Poisoning)

An ARP spoofing attack works as follows:

1. The attacker must have access to the network. They scan the network to determine the IP addresses of at least two devicesâ€”let's say these are a workstation and a router.
2. The attacker uses a spoofing tool to send out forged ARP responses.
3. The forged responses advertise that the correct MAC address for both IP addresses, belonging to the router and workstation, is the attacker's MAC address. This fools both the router and workstation into connecting to the attacker's machine, instead of each other.
4. The two devices update their ARP cache entries and from that point onwards, communicate with the attacker instead of directly with each other.
5. The attacker is now secretly in the middle of all communications.

## Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- A computer with a network interface card (NIC) that supports raw socket programming (e.g., Linux or macOS)
- A network cable to connect to the target network

### Software Requirements

- Python
- Scapy
- Packet capture and analysis tool (e.g., Wireshark or Tcpdump)

## Steps to Follow

### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. Install Python and Scapy on your computer.
2. Set up a network cable to connect your computer to the target network.
3. Install a packet capture and analysis tool (e.g., Wireshark or Tcpdump) to inspect and analyze network traffic.

### Step 2: Understand ARP Protocol

Study the ARP protocol and its packet structure. Familiarize yourself with ARP packet types:
- ARP Request
- ARP Reply

### Step 3: Write the ARP Spoofer Code

The provided code sets up an ARP spoofer. It creates ARP reply packets that advertise the attacker's MAC address as the correct address for the target IP. 

### Step 4: Test the ARP Spoofer

1. Run the ARP spoofer code on your computer.
2. Use a packet capture and analysis tool to inspect ARP traffic on the target network.
3. Verify that the ARP spoofer is working correctly.

### Step 5: Refine and Optimize the ARP Spoofer

1. Refine the ARP spoofer code to handle errors and optimize performance.
2. Test the ARP spoofer on different networks and devices.

### Important Notes

- Use ARP spoofing responsibly and only for authorized testing purposes.
- ARP spoofing can be detected by devices with ARP spoofing detection mechanisms.
- ARP spoofing can be used for intercepting and redirecting traffic, potentially enabling man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `arp_spoof.py` script.

```sh
python arp_spoof.py
